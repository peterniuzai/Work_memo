Crabbers...

Leuschner is back up, thanks to efforts by Frank and Bill.

We are running on a new computer called heiles2 (the other is called
heiles).

Everthing is the same as it was EXCEPT we now use port 41 instead of
port 31. This means:

1. when you ssh into leuschner, use

 	alias sshl "ssh -XY radiolab@leuschner.berkeley.edu -p 41"

2. when you access leuschner using VNC, use the statements

     ssh -L 59XX:127.0.0.1:5901 -p 41 -N -f radiolab@leuschner.berkeley.edu

     vncviewer localhost::59XX

where XX is a number (see my email of May 18, added below)

===========================

We don't understand why the telescope stops. For now, we are imposing an
upper limit on azimuth of 300 degrees. This will reduce the hour angle
coverage towards the west. When we figure out what's going on, we
will remove this restriction.

The disk area under /home/radiolab is blank -- that is, we have not
transferred the files from heiles to the heiles2 computer for the
radiolab account. if this is a problem, let me know and I'll do it today.
